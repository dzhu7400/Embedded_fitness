The function of this project is to be able to track the exercises: jumping jacks, squats, push-ups, and sit-ups. The microcontroller is powered by a lithium polymer
battery and will be placed around the user's abdomen. I put strings in the connection pads so that it can be worn by the user and these other strings can be
tightened. The program will start when the user hits this button. Each rep of an exercise will have every neopixel light up. For jumping jacks, the lights will be
green. For squats, the lights will be red. For push ups, the lights will be yellow and for sit-ups, the lights will be blue. The microcontroller will also emit a
sound of a different frequency, with the jumping jacks being the lowest frequency and squats being the highest frequency, in alphabetical order. Once the user has
finished an exercise, all the neopixels will light up a different color. If the user wants to stop the current exercise or wants to move on to the next exercise,
they can push the reset button on the microcontroller. The user will be doing ten repetitions of each exercise.
